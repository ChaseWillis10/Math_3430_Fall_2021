Question 01) Recently we discussed floating point arithmetic, which has become
the standard way of representing numbers on a computer. One of the key aspects
of floating point numbers is that the gap between a number and it's floating
point representation increases with the magnitude of the number. 
This differs from what is called a "fixed
point" representation, where the gap is constant. 

What is an advantage or disadvantage to using floating point instead of fixed
point?

The first of two main advantages that floating point has over fixed point is that floating point can
represent values between integers. This is important for getting a much closer correct answer then fixed
point. The second advantage that floating point has is that since they can represent values between
integers then they have a greater range of values that can be represented which is also important for
getting a closer correct answer. However, there is also disadvantages of using floatin point and the
main issue is that over calculations you can start to lose precision.

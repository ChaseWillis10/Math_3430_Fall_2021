Question 01)

Briefly describe a computing project you would find interesting to work on in
the future. This project may be

1) Implementing existing mathematics as algorithms, as we have done in this
course.

2) A simple project to learn another computing language.

3) An addition to the linear algebra package from your final project. 

4) A project to learn more complex tools in python. (Such as numpy, scipy,
pandas, machine learning packages such as tensorflow, etc...)

5) A computer application (such as a video game, art tools, music editor, etc..)

6) Any other type of project which I have failed to mention here. 

Building a computer application would be very fun especially a small little video game. I have done a game before
which was Bang! The Dice Game which was really fun but there was a lot of moving parts and code that made it fuction.
But doing a small game maybe like tic tac toe or something similar would be very fun to do but not overally hard
either. I also think a project learning how to use other libraries like the one mentioned above would also be great
to learn.
